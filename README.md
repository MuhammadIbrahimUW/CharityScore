# CharityScore aims to provide a measure of efficiency  on expenditures of Canadian charities

### This program is divided into three parts: Data Collection, Statistical Calculation, and Scoring Algorithm.

### The final product is a dataframe consisting of a letter grade for each charity with available information. I hope to soon produce a web application to allow users to search for individual charities and view their scores.

#### Data Credits: charitydata.ca (sourced from CRA T3010 returns)

##### Disclaimer: This is an attempt to create transparency in the non-profit sector (something I believe is very important) and showcase my programming ability.  A low score is not intended to mean that the charity is conducting itself illegitamtely or poorly. All data is reported as is from charitydata.ca and may not represent the latest information.

Please refer to CharityScore.ipynb for the latest version of this program.
